            The style/structure is bootstrapped with bloomer.js (a
            component lib built on the Bulma css framework), then
            modified with a custom layer of SCSS. Wherever encapsulation
            and re-usability were a priority, I used jsx inline styles
            to guarantee consistent behaviors site-wide.
